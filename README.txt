Local Hub v2
==========================

1. Run LocalHub_v2.exe.
2. Select a folder to share.
3. (Optional) Enter your Ngrok Auth Token if you want public access.
   - You can get a free token at dashboard.ngrok.com
4. Click Start Server.

Troubleshooting:
- If the app doesn't start, ensure ngrok.exe is in the same folder as the LocalHub_v2.exe folder.
- Ensure Port 2004 is not blocked by your firewall.
